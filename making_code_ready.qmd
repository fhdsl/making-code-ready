## Outline

- **Why** make your code ready for publication?
- **What** do you need to make it ready?
- **How** and where do you make it available?

## Why?
![[image.png]]

## Why: Documentation is Important

- Do it for Future You
- Others in your lab
- Others in your field

## Why: Reproducibility Matters

- [Duke Medicine biomarker scandal](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/duke-cancer-scandal-and-personalized-medicine)
- Software is an important output

## What: Minimum Information for Analyses

- Data Analysis in R / Python
	- Organize your analysis in a folder and share in a repository
	- Notebook(s)
	- Lockfile
	- Data (if small enough)
- Genomic Processing (not covered today)
	- Accession Number for your Dataset
	- List of files processed in workflow
	- WDL or Nextflow workflow file

## Project Example:

```
my_project/                ## Top level
├── data/                   ## Data directory
│   └── my_data.vcf  
├─- output/                 ## Share output    
└── 01_preprocessing.R     ## Scripts in order
└── 02_deseq2_analysis.qmd
└── 03_visualization.ipynb
├── renv.lock              ## Packages 
|						   ## installed with
|                          ## Version numbers
└── README.md
```

## Relative Paths

Everything should be runnable from the top folder of the project. Use relative paths from the project folder:

```r
my_data <- readr::read_csv("data/datafile.csv")
```

Example of a reproducible project:

[https://github.com/biodev/beataml2_manuscript](https://github.com/biodev/beataml2_manuscript)

## What: README

```
my_project/                ## Top level
└── README.md
```

![[Pasted image 20251219130456.png]]

- First thing that people will see
	- https://github.com/biodev/HNSCC_Notebook
- Document the basic workflow of processing
	- How does the data come together in the analysis?

## What: Notebooks / Analysis Files
```
my_project/                ## Top level    
├── 01_preprocessing.R     ## Scripts in order
├── 02_deseq2_analysis.qmd
└── 03_visualization.ipynb
```

- Easiest: place in your root folder
- Number in order
	- `01_preprocessing.R`
	- `02_deseq2_analysis.qmd`
- Use relative paths in your scripts
	- Ensures portability across computers
	- `read_csv("data/seq_counts.csv")`

## What: Lockfile

```
my_project/                ## Top level
├── renv.lock   
```

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[Python Project] --"pip freeze"--> B["requirements.txt"]
```

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[R Project] --"renv::snapshot()"--> B["renv.lock"]
```

- List of packages and versions that you used in analysis
- Post analysis:
    - Python: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
    - R: `renv::snapshot()`
- Talk about `rv` and `uv` in Package management session

## Reproducing environment from lockfile



## What: Data in a Project
```
my_project/                ## Top level
├── data                   ## Data directory
│   └── my_data.vcf  
```

- Genomic and omics data is large
    - raw data is not practical for GitHub (100 Mb limit)
    - Store raw files in required respositories
- Supply intermediate formats used to do the analysis:
    - MAF
    - VCF
    - CSV
    
## What: A Note about data

- Large genomic data - sharing raw data is impractical
	- Use Intermediate formats instead, such as VCF files, CSV files
- Data repositories
	- Open Science Framework
	- Required databases (dbGAP)
	- Be aware that you will need to provide metadata
		- Experimental design
- With code, share File Manifests - list the files you processed
    - JSON files from workflows
    - Metadata / Experimental Design
        - Where does each sample fit into Experimental Design?
- Focus on shareable formats

## What: Computational Environments

![[image 1.png]]

- Bare minimum:
    - Lockfiles
        - `requirements.txt` Python
            - `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
        - `renv.lock`  R
            - `renv::snapshot()` to generate `renv.lock` file
            - `rv migrate renv` to move to `rv`
- Docker Containers
    - Docker Q&A session
- Don’t try to create Dockerfiles from scratch
    - Community Images: BioC, Rocker Project, WILDS Docker Library
    - Use https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
        - https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/#config-files
- Launch on BinderHub
    - https://github.com/biodev/HNSCC_Notebook

## How and Where: Testing your shared project

- Try downloading and installing on a different computer to make sure that you can rerun analyses
- Take someone else through the process and test out the notebooks
- If making binder ready: test the repository on Binder

## Review Opportunities
- Review Opportunities
    - Data House Calls
    - PyOpenSci and ROpenSci for code review if you decide to package your code
    - WILDS WDL Library
    - WILDS Docker Library (?)
        - If you’re making a package
## How and Where: Sharing Your Analyses

- GitHub (for code)
- Open Science Framework (for code + data)
- Field specific databases
- Social Media: LinkedIn, Bluesky, etc.

## Where should you share code?

Share in a public repository:

- GitHub
- Codeberg
- ReadtheDocs

Be aware of file size limitations!
